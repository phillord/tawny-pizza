Pizza

== Introduction


This package implements a version of the Pizza ontology that has been widely
used as a demonstrator of the OWL language as
[described](http://robertdavidstevens.wordpress.com/2010/01/22/why-the-pizza-ontology-tutorial/).
It uses the
[Clojure-owl](http://www.russet.org.uk/blog/category/all/professional/tech/clojure-owl) to generate OWL. 

This is intended as a demonstrator of the functionality of the Clojure-OWL
package.
